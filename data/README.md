It contains the raw datset that without segmentation:
Here is the summary of the dataset:
* Individual household electric power consumption Data Set

The description is illustrated below in each subsubsection:

### Individual household electric power consumption Data Set
#### Abstract:
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. The more detailed information is available in [URL](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption).

Note that the values of some entries are missing,
although their datatimes are present,
and missing values are represented by `?`.

#### Attribute Information:
1. date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
